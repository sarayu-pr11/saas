# Project Description Team SAAS
Our goal this trimester with our website is to make a helpful and viable alternative to phyiscal manuals during an evacuation. We hope to convert all paper necessities into an online format as well as add other pages that would make evacuating on short notice easier. Overall, we hope to make the hassle of evacuation as simple and least stressful as possible.
